Hi! I am a PhD researcher in Artificial Intelligence and Social Network Analysis. I did my PhD in the Grupo de Inteligencia y Artificial Razonamiento Aproximado in the Public University of Navarre. I am also a former visiting researcher in the University of Essex, Uk. I am soon to start a Postdoc YUFE position in the University of Essex. My research interests include computational intelligence, social network analysis, XAI and computer vision.  My research interests include computational intelligence, social network analysis, XAI and computer vision.

Besides science, my personal interests include playing the piano and the guitar, reading lots about ancient history, MTG, and karate. My favourite book is La Regenta, by Leopoldo Alas “Clarín”.
