Hi! I am [Postdoc YUFE MSCA fellow](https://www.yufe4postdocs.eu/) in the University of Essex, researching in Artificial Intelligence and perception. I did my PhD in the Grupo de Inteligencia y Artificial Razonamiento Aproximado (GIARA) in the Public University of Navarre under the supervision of [Prof. Humberto Bustince](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=9SI4W2kAAAAJ&hl=es&oi=ao)
 and [Prof. Óscar Cordón](https://scholar.google.es/citations?hl=es&user=oUmv8xgAAAAJ). During my PhD I also was a visiting researcher in the University of Essex, under the supervision of [Prof Hani Hagras](https://scholar.google.es/citations?hl=es&user=ZZ61SZwAAAAJ).

Besides science, my personal interests include playing the piano and the guitar, reading lots about ancient history, MTG, and dancing! My favourite book is La Regenta, by Leopoldo Alas “Clarín”.

Looking for BSc/Msc thesis or TFG/TFM projects? Be sure to send me an email. As of today, I am willing to supervise projects about:

* Extendending exFuzzy functionalities.
* Fuzzy rule-based reasoning.
* Dynamic feature selection in classification problems.

But of course, I am always open to hear about new ideas.
